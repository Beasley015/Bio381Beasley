## Are you ready for...

2019 MARCH MAMMAL MADNESS!

## What is \color{red}#MMM?

- Like NCAA march madness... but for nerds
- Simulated "battles" that account for size, weaponry, behavior, etc.
- Battle narratives are live-tweeted for maximum drama

## Sample bracket

## Benefits of \color{red}#MMM

Educators use \color{red}#MMM \color{black}to teach...  
```
- Evolution  
- Ecology  
- SciComm  
```  
...but most of us are just here for the shenanigans

## There have been weird moments in \color{red}#MMM \color{black}
Stoats as Measurement, for example...

##  

So fill out a bracket.  
It's fun.  
And the organizers put a lot more effort into it  
than I did these slides.
