Habitat Type,Highest Richness,Highest Abundance,Possible Explanation
Active farm,X,O,Rich increases with food availability
Active farm,O,X,Abund increases with food availability
Active farm,O,O,Rich/Abund lowest with lowest habitat complexity
Active farm,X,X,Rich/Abund increase with food availability
Abandoned farm,X,O,Rich increases with habitat complexity; low relative proportion of niche type limits abund
Abandoned farm,O ,X,"Abund increases with habitat complexity, but generalists only"
Abandoned farm,O,O,Depauparate transition community
Abandoned farm,X,X,Rich/Abund increase with habitat complexity
Forest,X,O,Richness increases with stability
Forest,O,X,Abund increases with stability; specialists exclude generalists
Forest,O,O,Lower habitat complexity + lower food availability limits both metrics
Forest,X,X,Rich/Abund increase with stability
